Hi! This is a (currently) simple mod I am working on that adds a system for attributes like increased health, armor, and strength

What we've got:
    - Attribute system (5 attributes that make the player more powerful)
    - Ability system (3 abilities, dash, overshield, and arrow storm)
    - GUI interface (access by pressing K by default)
    - HUD cooldown and passive trigger display
    - Use primary ability with X, and secondary with V
    - Experience system to level up

TODO:
    - More abilities


Thanks for being interested in this mod!
